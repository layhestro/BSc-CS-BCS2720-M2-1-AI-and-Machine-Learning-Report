\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Summary}
We propose a three-phase plan to predict properties of Unity ML-Agents training runs using supervised ML. The project couples a tiered experimental design (15 environments; PPO/SAC/POCA/IL) with automated logging and a reproducible repo. Roles, risks, and milestones are defined to ensure timely delivery and data quality.

\subsection{Expected Outcomes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Dataset:} 65–100 runs with configuration, hardware, duration, reward, and RAM metrics; shared to the course repository.
  \item \textbf{Models:} Predictors for duration, final reward, and peak RAM; target performance \emph{R$^{2}$} $\ge$ 0.6 on at least two tasks (data-dependent).
  \item \textbf{Insights:} Which hyperparameters and algorithms most affect time, performance, and memory; practical guidance for planning RL experiments.
  \item \textbf{Infrastructure:} Public, well-documented GitHub repo (automation, schema, notebooks, results).
\end{itemize}
